[F]Got into an [C]accident and [G]couldn't come to [C]school. (Well) But (then)
[F]When he finally [G]came  [C]back
[G]His [C]hair [F]had turned from [C]black into [G]bright white
He [G#]said that it was [C]from when
The [G#]cars had smashed [Fadd#11] so [F]hard

Once there was this girl who
Wouldn't go to change with the girls in the change room
But when they finally made her
They saw birthmarks all over her body
She couldn't quite explain it
They'd always just been there

{c: CHORUS}

[Dm]  (But) both girl and [C]boy [G]were glad
[Dm]One kid had it [C]worse than [G]that [F]

'Cause then there was a boy whose
Parents made him come directly home right after school. 
And when they went to their church
They shook and lurched all over the church floor
He couldn't quite ex plain it
They'd always just gone there

{c: CHORUS}

[Dm] Aaah [C]aah  [G]aah
[Dm] Aaah [C]aah  [G]aah
[F]   [C]
[Dm] Aaah [C]aah  [G]aah
[Dm] Aaah [C]aah  [G]aah
